Subject: Test whether or not destructors appear in any expression
Message-Id: <9edd1b318c453d9a-0-artemis@nixos>
resolution: fixed

If no destructors appear in any expression, then we shouldn't include
them in samples, since they're not really being treated like functions
(despite the fact that they're included in the same namespace, since TIP
will complain if e.g. a variable is given the same name as a
destructor).
