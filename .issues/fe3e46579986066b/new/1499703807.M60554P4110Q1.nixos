Subject: 'default' is a keyword
Message-Id: <fe3e46579986066b-0-artemis@nixos>
resolution: fixed

Pattern matches can include a 'default' case, which matches when the
others don't.

We don't currently handle this. Add tests which flag this behaviour,
then fix.

See tip2015/escape_Injective.smt2 as an example.
