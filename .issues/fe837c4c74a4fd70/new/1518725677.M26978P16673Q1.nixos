Subject: Narrow down cache dependencies
Message-Id: <fe837c4c74a4fd70-0-artemis@nixos>
resolution: fixed

The racket scripts in cache.nix can now be restricted to only depend on
the scripts/lib files they need. This prevents us having to rebuild
things unnecessarily (e.g. during a testing/debugging feedback loop).

So far only 'BENCHMARKS' takes advantage of this. We should check the
others.
