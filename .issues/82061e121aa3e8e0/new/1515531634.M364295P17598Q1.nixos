Subject: all-canonical-function-names in BENCHMARKS_CACHE is a lie
Message-Id: <82061e121aa3e8e0-0-artemis@nixos>
resolution: fixed

It contains destructors as well as
functions. BENCHMARKS_ONLY_FUNCTION_NAMES contains function names
without including destructors. We should fix the former, to make the
latter unnecessary.
